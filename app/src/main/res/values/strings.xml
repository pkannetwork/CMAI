    <string name="settingsmenu_about_description">This application pulls recent apps from the CyanogenMod ROM and attempts to install them via. Root or non-root methods onto any ROM on a device.\n\nI cannot guarantee compatibility with the applications and your device, and I do not take responsibility if it breaks your device (though \'uninstall\' will often revert any problems caused). It has been extensively tested for your peace of mind, and I hope you have success in installing these applications.\n\nFeel free to contact me below, or if you like my work, buy me a drink :)\n\nthementalgoose@gmail.com</string>
